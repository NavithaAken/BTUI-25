METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

Methods for Processing the Data

The development of the website followed a structured and systematic workflow to ensure clarity, functionality, and a professional final outcome. The main stages of the methodology are described below:

1. Initial Planning and Interface Design

The project began with planning the structure and visual layout of the website.
I used Wireframe.cc to design the wireframes for each page, including the homepage, navigation menu, event sections, and layouts. This helped me visualize the user flow, decide on section placement, and ensure a clean, user-friendly interface from the start.

2. Content Gathering and Refinement

For the textual content—such as descriptions, introductions, and section explanations—I used school websites. I then refined this content manually to ensure accuracy, relevance, and tone consistency. This phase also involved gathering additional descriptions and event details to populate various parts of the site.

3. Collecting Visual Resources

Next, I gathered all required images, icons, and graphics, ensuring they matched the website’s theme and maintained high visual quality. I used school websites to gather the images of upcoming events and news.

4. Development of the Website

I created the index.html file as the foundation of the website and gradually built out the structure for all other pages. During this stage:

I applied custom CSS, animations, and responsive layouts.

I added JavaScript for interactive elements such as the mobile navigation menu, countdown timer, and event calendar.

I used the Bootstrap CDN to ensure responsive design and to speed up the styling process.

I tested each section individually for functionality and responsiveness across different screen sizes.

6. Version Control and Deployment

Once the development was stable, I created a GitHub repository to manage source control and track changes.
Finally, I deployed the entire site using GitHub Pages, making it publicly accessible for review, testing, and presentation.

7. Overall Duration

The complete development process—from planning to deployment—took approximately 7 to 12 days, including designing, coding, debugging, content preparation, and final polishing.
